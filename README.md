## Data Warehousing and Business Intelligence for IMDB Datasets

Welcome to the Data Warehousing and Business Intelligence for IMDB Datasets GitHub repository!

### Project Overview
- **Objective**: The main objective of this project was to design and implement a data warehouse for IMDB datasets, enabling efficient storage, retrieval, and analysis of data for business intelligence purposes.
- **Dataset**: The project involved working with the IMDB dataset, which contains structured and unstructured data related to movies, TV shows, and people involved in the entertainment industry.
- **Tools Used**: Alteryx was utilized for extracting structured and unstructured data from different sources and ingesting more than 75 million records into a staging schema. Additionally, Tableau and Power BI were used for creating dashboards and visualizations for business analysis.

### Key Achievements
- **Data Warehouse Design**: Designed and implemented a data warehouse architecture tailored to the needs of the IMDB dataset, ensuring efficient storage and retrieval of data.
- **Data Extraction and Loading**: Utilized Alteryx to extract data from various sources and load it into the staging schema, processing more than 75 million records.
- **Data Transformation**: Implemented techniques such as Slowly Changing Dimensions (SCD) and rejection logics to ensure data consistency and integrity.
- **Business Intelligence**: Developed BI schemas for Movies, TV shows, and People, and created over 15 dashboards using Tableau and Power BI for in-depth business analysis and visualization.

### Repository Contents
- **Documentation**: Contains documentation related to the project, including design specifications, data dictionaries, and user manuals.
- **Scripts**: Includes scripts used for data extraction, transformation, and loading processes.
- **Dashboards**: Contains files for the dashboards created using Tableau and Power BI for visualizing and analyzing the IMDB dataset.
